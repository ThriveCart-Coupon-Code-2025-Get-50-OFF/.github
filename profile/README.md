## Automatically Applying ThriveCart Coupon To a Checkout

So, we have created our very first coupon. Now the question comes, how to set up those ThriveCart coupons to get automatically applied while a customer is checking out.

Let's dive into how you can set this up:

### Getting Your Coupon URL

There are a couple of straightforward methods to obtain a URL that automatically applies a coupon:

**From Your Product's 'Cart URL' Page**:

![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXf2jXoXAARM-Klykzm2LYHQMjSOU7a1DgVQW56I8BgigX6VJ66rHO8OXndD_2HAKEExV7Mri9ZmDFZblcCIIUmQzGc_3yMmmZgWU_DVFTFxu3KFAOhVLmE5dza_wEU3x07S8TKQSQ?key=5fI_2zDiiHmrP87QzjBwipSJ)

**Access the 'Cart URL' Page**: After creating your first ThriveCart coupon, navigate to its 'Cart URL' page. You can also get there by clicking the '**get URL**' button in your dashboard.

**Select 'Coupon URLs'**: On this page, click the **Cart URLs**' tab. This will present a list of valid coupons associated with your product.

**Copy the Coupon URL**: Choose the desired coupon and click '**Copy Coupon URL**' to copy it to your clipboard.

![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfoJGAvwqi9s8JDvyZcHc-E2WGq8AzhA3ZoePoODc2YWjqQfo2TF_TN1AklRZgIgCLiNpOfnu2QdL5zOZqDyn5-XX35M3AjBl0pKOR0dJtb2W234DiH-qrdwp-lj8omb-bWjUNl?key=5fI_2zDiiHmrP87QzjBwipSJ)

Your coupon URL will look something like this:

https://youracc.thrivecart.com/product-name/?coupon=abc

![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcp8rCDBuw1Lm4iAZNjPhN95ZLQYn5H-QiwPbIT876ixoXqmDwyXaPcFKg-KETR8Jb0sj3VRi-ZM4PbDyI9TRx_jnNfu6gtCFUnUcaf2Wdwc6C-scTBqZ4OuidnEzwp58mYg3uUtw?key=5fI_2zDiiHmrP87QzjBwipSJ)

**Copy the URL**: Find the coupon you want to use and click the 'Copy URL' button. A window will pop up where you can select the product to which this coupon applies.

After selecting, click '**Copy & continue**' to copy the URL to your clipboard.

![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXez6pyQmq85O4oVLhqGTmEAX98ShTMUB-JavOk2ZW3qcaAZPsATcoouUArRqcSC350PgdvOD-8WTZgCsfMr2xu95r_PSIVe09l-35WTDdYBlm4x8XTwAKLoIQ7oV-FT7BqWFCbqnQ?key=5fI_2zDiiHmrP87QzjBwipSJ)

**Applying Coupons to Embedded Carts**

If you've embedded a cart on your website, you can still automatically apply a coupon by adding the coupon code to your page's URL.

For example:

https://yourwebsite.com/cartpage/?coupon=abc

Replace "yourwebsite.com/cartpage" with the actual URL of your cart page and "abc" with your coupon code.

**Combining Coupon Application with Pre-Selected Pricing Options**

ThriveCart gives you the facility to pre-select a specific pricing option while automatically applying a coupon.

In order to do that, you need to modify your checkout URL by adding both the coupon and the desired pricing plan.

For instance, to apply the coupon "abc" and select the second pricing option, your URL would be:

https://checkouturl.com/product-name/?coupon=abc&plan=2

With this approach, you guarantee that the customer will see the correct pricing option with the discount applied when they arrive at your checkout page.

**Automatically Adding a Coupon Without a Coupon URL to Embedded Carts**

You will need to add a small code in the cart‚Äôs embed code if you want to ensure a specific coupon is pre-applied when the cart loads.

data-thrivecart-querystring="coupon=abc"

Just replace ‚Äúabc‚Äù with your actual coupon code.

Replace "abc" with your actual coupon code.

Here's how it might look in your embed code (using a modal cart as an example):

<script async src="//thrivecart.com/embed/v1/thrivecart.js"></script>

<a data-thrivecart-account="mycart" data-thrivecart-product="12" data-thrivecart-querystring="coupon=‚ÄùMYOFFER" class="thrivecart-button thrivecart-button-styled thrivecart-button-red">Buy now!</a>

In this example, product 12 on the account "mycart" will have the "MYOFFER" coupon automatically applied when the cart loads.

This is particularly useful if you want to offer a discount to all customers without requiring them to click a specific coupon link.

Just follow all these steps to streamline the checkout process for your customers, making it easier for them to take advantage of your discounts and promotions.

This will enhance user experience and also lead to an increase in conversion, which will generate more revenue for your business.
